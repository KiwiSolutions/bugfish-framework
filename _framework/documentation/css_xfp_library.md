# CSS Framework
	CSS Files for different purposes to include in your
	site if needed!

## xfp_library [Mastered]
	Default CSS Classes for XFP-Template and   
	Cookiebanner / Eventboxes
	Mostly the IDs and Classes are used in the xfp-template file, if 
	you do not use the template, this file is a good place
	to get some style inspirations for eventboxes or cookiebanners
	(for example) For details study the file itself. You should not
	work with this css file if you are not using the xfp_library
	Functions.

You can set the $x_css_color variable with a color code like "#111111" to change   
Themes color. You can do that by creating a settings.php file at the folder, at 
where the framework  folder  is inside. (Set the variable with color Code there.)

If you intent to use another file, you can change this in the css code.  
But keep in mind that if you update the framework from this repository, your changes  
may be overwritten...
