# Free Website Template
	Template to deploy fast 
	backend or frontend webpages. 
	Not much documented. See the Files and use my classes
	and functions. In this folder is a websites template to build
	up a website with different functions 
	included in the framework. Its more for 
	internal purpose, more focus in this framework 
	is on the provided classes and functions. This 
	template should have the framework itself included 
	to work properly. But you can kee this section it 
	out of sight, im using it for fast deployment.

	To use you need to include the repositories
	_framework folder into this folders _framework folder.
